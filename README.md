## Description

This repository focuses on statistical modeling for predicting diamond prices. We start with a summary of Phase 1, which involved data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. We then proceed with model fitting using multiple linear regression, including one-hot encoding for categorical features and exploring interactions and higher order terms. Eventually, we use fitted various models and analyzed to understand the influence of different features on diamond prices.
